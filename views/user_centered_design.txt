How do you design mindset??

Dont design the ski, design the turn. 
  Dont design a product, design the experience
    What does the user want?

  Expanding language increases opportunity
  Changing language in small, deliberate ways changes systems

  two things to make change happen

  Innovation happens at the edges
    where you can test new language, ideas
    Dont compete, Provide Perspective
      tension between opposing ideas is where best ideas come from

WHy does mindset Matter?
  a powerful, unique and shared way of shaping intent, culture, and change

  tension causes new things to arise
    not about conflict

What single word defines our message/mindset
